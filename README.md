**Occupy: Web-based Real Estate Management System** that helps the real estate industry to monitor all the transaction between the company and customer. It manage customer accounts, documents, users, residents, reserved customer and properties. It also has a Drag and Drop features for task management that staff and manager can work with by assigning and creating task for the employees, to implement this kind of features we used React Beautiful DND by Atlassian. We used Django for the backend which is a python based server side framework, since we used python, we also integrate machine learning using Decision tree for customer segmenation and ARIMA for the sales analysis/sales forecasting. For the real time features we use Pusher a real time services for our notification and messaging. Lastly we use AWS and Heroku for our cloud storage,databased and hosting.
